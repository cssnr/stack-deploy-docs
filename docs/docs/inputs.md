## Details

### name

the stack name for Swarm and project name for Compose.

Example: `cool-stack`

### file

Stack file or Compose file(s). _Swarm_ only supports 1 file per stack.

_Compose._ [Multiple files](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/multiple-compose-files/) can be provided, space seperated. and the `-f` flag will be prepended to each file.

Example: `web.yaml db.yaml`  
Output: `-f web.yaml -f db.yaml`

### mode

**Compose Only.** Set this to `compose` to use [compose up](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/compose/up/) instead of [stack deploy](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/stack/deploy/) for non-swarm hosts.

### args

**Compose Only.** Compose arguments to pass to the `compose up` command. Only used for `mode: compose` deployments.
The `detach` flag defaults to false for compose. With no args the default is `--remove-orphans --force-recreate`.
Use an empty string to override. For more details, see the compose
[docs](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/compose/up/).

Example: `--remove-orphans --force-recreate`

### host

The hostname or IP address of the remote docker server to deploy too.
If your hostname is behind a proxy like Cloudflare you will need to use the IP address.

If you don't know your Public IP, you may be able to find it using one of these commands.

::: code-group

```shell [curl ~vscode-icons:file-type-shell~]
curl ip.me
```

```shell [curl -4 ~vscode-icons:file-type-shell~]
curl -4 ifconfig.co
```

```shell [wget ~vscode-icons:file-type-shell~]
echo $(wget -qO- https://ipecho.net/plain)
```

```shell [dig ~vscode-icons:file-type-shell~]
dig TXT +short o-o.myaddr.l.google.com @ns1.google.com
```

:::

### pass/ssh_key

You must provide either a `pass` or `ssh_key`, but **not** both.

When using a password, a temporary key is generated using [ssh-keygen](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh-copy-id)
and copied to the host using [ssh-copy-id](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh-copy-id).
The authorized_keys file is [cleaned up](https://github.com/cssnr/stack-deploy-action/blob/master/src/main.sh#L10) after each deploy.

To generate an SSH run the following as the `user` you are using:

::: code-group

```shell [rsa ~vscode-icons:file-type-shell~]
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -N ""
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

```shell [ed25519 ~vscode-icons:file-type-shell~]
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -N ""
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

:::

### disable_keyscan

This will disable the [ssh-keyscan](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh-keyscan) command. **Advanced usage only.**

### env_file

Variables in this file are exported before running stack deploy.
If you need compose file templating this can also be done in a previous step.
If using `mode: compose` you can also add the `compose_arg: --env-file stringArray`.

::: tip IMPORTANT
**This is NOT** the Docker compose [env_file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/environment-variables/set-environment-variables/#use-the-env_file-attribute) directive.
That is set in your compose file as normal.
:::

### detach

**Swarm Only.** Set this to `false` to not exit immediately and wait for the services to converge.
This will generate extra output in the logs and is useful for debugging deployments.

Defaults to `false` in `mode: compose`.

### resolve_image

**Swarm Only.** When the default `always` is used, this argument is omitted.

### registry_auth

**Swarm Only.** Set to `true` to deploy with `--with-registry-auth`.

If setting `registry_user`/`registry_pass` this is implied.

### registry_host

To run [docker login](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/login/) on another registry.

Example: `ghcr.io`

### registry_user/registry_pass

Required to run [docker login](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/login/) before stack deploy.

### summary

Write a Summary for the job. To disable this set to `false`.

For more information see [Job Summary](../guides/features.md#job-summary).
