# Features

Deploy a Docker [stack](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/stack/deploy/) or [compose](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/compose/up/) file, to a remote host over SSH,
using a [remote context](https://docs.docker.com/engine/manage-resources/contexts/). This deploys the stack from the current workspace without copying files.

- Deploy to Docker Swarm or Compose.
- Deploy over SSH using keyfile or password.
- Deploy from the current working directory.
- Deploy from a private registry with credentials.
- [Job Summary](#job-summary) with deployment output, including errors.
- Supports multiple compose file and stack deployments.
- Allows setting custom arguments for the deployment command.

You can [get started here](get-started.md) or view [workflow examples](examples.md).

## Rolling Tags

The following rolling [tags](https://github.com/cssnr/stack-deploy-action/tags) are maintained to improve stability across updates.

| Version&nbsp;Tag                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Rolling | Bugs | Feat. |   Name    |  Target  | Example  |

| [![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/cssnr/stack-deploy-action?style=for-the-badge&label=%20&color=red)](https://github.com/cssnr/stack-deploy-action/releases/latest)                           |   ‚ùå    |  ‚ùå  |  ‚ùå   | **Micro** | `vN.N.N` | `vN.N.N` |

You can view the release notes for each version on the [releases](https://github.com/cssnr/stack-deploy-action/releases) page.

The **Major** tag is recommended. It is the most up-to-date and always backwards compatible.
Breaking changes would result in a **Major** version bump. At a minimum you should use a **Minor** tag.
